	In this package are : 
</p><p>	
	graphics.h : the default header that includes all the others required 
		     so that you don't have to do anything differently.
</p><p>	
	libgraph.c : the code for functions in graphics.h. These are mainly
		     the basic settings and initialization functions.
</p><p>	
	
	grtext.h : the functions for text manipulation -- This basic part 
		   of this code has been borrowed from Karl Bartel's 
		   <karlb@gmx.net> SFont library. We extended it to fit 
		   our needs. 
</p><p>	
	text.c : code for functions in grtext.h
</p><p>	

	shapes.h : functions for drawing various shapes, filling and positioning. 
</p><p>	
	shapes.c : Code for the above definitions.
</p><p>	

	polygon.h : functions for drawing and filling polygons.
</p><p>	
	polygon.c :  Code for above functions. These two functions were made
			into a separate module because the code for fillpoly() is pretty
			healthy all by itself and requires quite a few book-keeping 
			non-trivial functions.
</p><p>	
	
	Makefile : We don't know how to write Makefiles. This one has been 
		   hacked up from someone else software. If u know more than us
		   on the subject please oblige by writing a custom Makefile
		   for the package.
	
</p><p>	
	README : That's what you are reading.
	
</p><p>	
	grc : a no-brainer script to compile libgraph programs.
	
</p><p>	
	./Font : Directory containing font(.png) files. There are a number of different
		 	colors but of the same font. Default font is white. Font-color 
		 	selection is still to be implemented. You can change the color by
		 	changing the FONT definition in graphics.h to a different color file
		 	and recompiling the library.
</p><p>	
	
	 sample.c : small sample file to try out the library.
		 	Just compile with
	   			$ ./grc sample
			and execute with
				$ ./sample

	I would suggest that you familiarize yourself with the basic SDL 
 functions before scratching around. All the SDL functions are documented in 
 man-pages. For a good intro, html documentation and samples refer the homepage 
 at <i><a href="http:\\www.libsdl.org">www.libsdl.org</a></i>

<p>

	The basic code for text functions has been borrowed from 
 Karl Bartel's <karlb@gmx.net> SFont library ( We can't seem to stress that 
 point enough ). We actually don't understand much of the basic initialization. 
 We just modified his output function to emulate terminal behaviour
 (eg. scrolling of text onto newline).
</p><p>	
	The input functions although written from scratch also borrow heavily 
 from Karl's code. Our code is not neatly organized or efficiently written. 
 There are parts which we think are unnecessary but are afraid to remove lest 
 we break something. The main challenge in this code ( and one that has not yet
 been met with ) is to emulate terminal behaviour by redirecting standard 
 I/O functions to use the graphical screen. 
</p><p>	
 
 The reason for stressing this is that we often see/use code like
</p><p>	
<blockquote>	
	initgraph( , , );<br>
	....<br>
	printf("Hello",,);<br>
	...<br>
	closegraph();<br>
</blockquote>
</p><p>	
	Now this may seem normal in DOS but in SDL the drawing is done on a 
 separate SDL_Surface structure while all I/O functions operate on stdin/stdout.
 Hence we check wether we are in graphics mode by setting and querying an 
 environment variable --- "LIBGRAPHICS_ACTIVE=1". Correspondingly we use 
 either our native functions or call variadic printf/scanf functions. You  
 might want to look up the variadic call conventions in  "$info libc".

</p>
<p>	  
	If you have implemented a function which has not yet been included, 
 I suggest that you write it in a separate header or program and test. 
 This way you can tweak it without recompiling the library. Once you are sure 
 of it's correctness mail it to me and it will be added to the main source
 (with attribution).

	If you read the Makefile you will find that libtool has been used to 
 link the library. This is because libgraph itself links to a number of 
 libraries  and we do not want to specify each one at compile time. To see how
 many dynamic libraries actually get involved type
